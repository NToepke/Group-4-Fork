# Design Documentation

With our project focusing mostly on documentation and not on software that can be accurately represented with the various diagrams we learned about in module 5 of this course, we believed that the best course of action for this sprint was to focus on identifying what parts of the documentation we wanted to change.

We also decided that we should agree on some form of consistent formatting. Because we did not plan to change all the documentation for the project but only to focus on the documentation we found to be insufficient, we decided it would be best if we attempted to mimic the formatting of the existing documentation of Augur.
