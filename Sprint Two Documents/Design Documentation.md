# Design Documentation

With our project focusing mostly on documentation and not on software that can be accurately represented with the various diagrams we learned about in module 5 of this course, we believed that the best course of action for this sprint was to focus on identifying what parts of the documentation we wanted to change.

We also decided that we should agree on some form of consistent formatting. Because we did not plan to change all the documentation for the project but only to focus on the documentation we found to be insufficient, we decided it would be best if we attempted to mimic the formatting of the existing documentation of Augur.

## Documentation Segments to Change
**Dead Links**  
There are occasional dead links in the documentation that we plan to revive.  
(Unified Data Model) https://oss-augur.readthedocs.io/en/main/schema/data-model.html

**Installation Instructions**
These where found to be lackign by both our team and others to get a working instance of Augur, our goal will be to figure out how to make the process more clear
## Documentation Segments to Add

## Formatring Example

## Example Header
- Step by step instruction to be given in bulleted list format
- Any comands to be used by the user will be formated in the following maner 
  > Example command line command

### Example Sub-header

- Example of a [link](https://oss-augur.readthedocs.io/en/main/quick-start.html) to another file and or external source (this one leads to the docs the formatting was based uppon)
- Last example of a step to be completed by user including another code block
  > Second example of command line command formatting
