# Common Issues

## Python version
More than likely when you see that you must install Python 3, you simply go to their website and download the newest version. However, this program uses older versions as the newest version seldom allows for the use of machine learning. Therefore, if you run into issues with your system's python, update your Python version to at least 3.8. These can be downloaded [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
