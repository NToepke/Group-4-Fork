# Issue Reports

- One of the ideas our group had for changes we could make to the documentation was to fix a plethora of the deadlinks we found in the documentation however while we were in the design phase of our project most but not all of these were patched. There was still the issue of the following link:
> Old link: https://oss-augur.readthedocs.io/en/main/schema/data-model.html
>
> New link: https://oss-augur.readthedocs.io/en/main/schema/overview.html

- Our team wanted to complete one of the segments of documentation that was labeled as "under construction" such as [Create A Metric](https://oss-augur.readthedocs.io/en/main/development-guide/create-a-metric/toc.html). However, after trying to understand the three sections that were listed as such, we were only able to understand the process for making a metric well enough to create documentation but not the other sections. This can be found under the header Create a Metric [here](https://github.com/NToepke/Group-4-Fork/blob/sprint4/Sprint%20Three%20Documents/Design%20Documentation.md).
